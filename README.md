iFixit interview project - Tanner Villarete

My attempt at creating a "my devices" web application. It allows you to search iFixit's database for your device and add your devices to your "bag". 
You can restart your browser as well without worrying about losing your devices. I had to come up with a bunch of workarounds since I couldn't find a way to search for a device directly by ID from iFixit's API (If there was a way and I overlooked it I will be mildly peeved). 
Overall, I'm fairly happy with what I've accomplished in only a day, and given a couple more days I will have 
this perfected.
